Contains code that can be run on the class server </br>
Creates elbow plot and then runs kmeans on netflow data </br>
Prints to terminal: elbow plot and dataframe with IPs and their clusters </br>
To run on a file use the flag --RawDatafile </br>
Ex: python ip_similar_ip.py --RawDatafile ../../../../data/converted/ft-v05.2021-03-14.144500-0600.csv
## Cyber_Code
Contains prelimary code that has been expanded upon to implement both kmeans and graph embedding
